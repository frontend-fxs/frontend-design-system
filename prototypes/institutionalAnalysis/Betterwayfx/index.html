                                                        The EURUSD maintained positive tone on Monday’s holiday-thinned market. The pair regained traction from Asian session low at 1.0601 after repeated failure to clearly penetrate daily Ichimoku cloud (spanned between 1.0621 and 1.0584), which continues to underpin near-term action. Fresh bullish acceleration peaked at 1.0670, retracing the largest part of 1.0677/1.0601 downleg, but failed to regain last week’s high at 1.0677 and open way towards key barrier at 1.0700.<br>
                                                        Profit-taking at the end of the day dragged the price below important double-Fibonacci barrier at 1.0648 (23.6% of 1.0906/1.0570 descend and 61.8% of 1.0677/1.0601 downleg) and sidelined immediate hopes of stronger recovery.
                                                        Studies on lower timeframes are bullish and expected to hold positive alignment on close above 1.0630 (daily Tenkan-sen).<br>
                                                        On the other side, daily technicals are bearish that keeps the downside vulnerable. Stronger bearish signal could be expected on close below initial pivots – daily Tenkan-sen / daily Ichimoku cloud top that would re-expose key supports at 1.0583/70 (daily Ichimoku cloud base / Apr 10 low). <br><br>

                                                        USD JPY currency pair took a breather on Monday, on recovery above 109.00 barrier, in attempts  above broken 200SMA barrier at 108.81 and signal stronger correction from fresh five-month low at 108.11, posted in early Monday’s trading. <br>
                                                        The pair is pressured by rising tensions over North Korea, following another missile test and US started bringing their warships in the region that prompted investors into safe-haven Japanese yen. Technical studies are firmly bearish and favour further easing towards next target at 107.86 (Fibonacci 61.8% of 101.18/118.66 rally). <br>
                                                        Monday’s bounce could be seen as technical correction on oversold conditions and should be ideally capped under 110.00 mark, before bears resume, as long bearish candle of last week (the biggest one-week loss since the third week of July 2016) heavily weighs on markets.<br><br>

                                                        GBPUSD pair held bullish tone on Monday, despite low volumes on extended holiday trading. In eventless session, cable was driven by bullish sentiment and positive technicals and extended recovery from last Thu/Fri higher base at 1.2500, to reach levels close to psychological 1.2600 barrier. Strong bullish setup of daily studies keeps focus at the upside, however, final push towards targets at 1.2615/24 (Mar 27 high/200SMA) could be delayed on overbought conditions. <br>
                                                        Slow stochastic on daily chart reversed from overbought territory, signalling consolidative/ corrective action which should be ideally contained by hourly Kijun-sen line at 1.2551, to keep intact session low / broken Fibonacci 61.8% of 1.2615/1.2365 at 1.2523. <br>
                                                        Alternative scenario requires return and break below 1.2500 pivot to revive near-term bears.<br><br>

                                                        The Aussie dollar  remains well supported and extended recovery against its US counterpart on Monday, ending the fourth straight bullish day on rally from 0.7472 base (Apr 10;11;12 lows). Extended correction that retraced over 61.8% of 0.7675/0.7472 descend, peaked at 0.7610 on brief probe above daily Ichimoku cloud top at 0.7605 that was capped by daily Kijun-sen for now.<br>
                                                        Consolidation under daily cloud top could be anticipated as slow stochastic is overbought on daily chart, with limited downside, ahead of renewed attack at key 0.7600/10 resistance zone. Firm break and close above here is needed to confirm recovery continuation towards target at 0.7679 (Mar 30 high).<br>

                                                        The GBPCAD cross extended gains on Monday, marking the third consecutive bullish day. Fresh bullish extension peaked at 1.6736 (over 76.4% retracement of 1.6800/1.6515 downleg) and generated strong bullish signal on close above 200SMA at 1.6690 and daily Tenkan-sen line at 1.6657. <br>
                                                        The latest move higher turned daily technical studies into full bullish setup for final push towards target at 1.6800 (Apr 6 high), with possible extension towards peaks of Mar 27/28 at 1.6888/80. <br>
                                                        Broken 200SMA is expected to protect the downside, as rising 20SMA is underpinning the action (currently at 1.6665).<br><br>

                                                        Dow accelerated strongly on Monday and peaked at 20580 after hitting nearly nine-week low at 20372 in early Monday’s trading. Strong rally left long bullish daily candle that formed Bullish Engulfing pattern, generating reversal signal, after downside attempts were contained by daily Ichimoku cloud base. <br>
                                                        Recovery needs extension above daily Tenkan-sen line at 20580 which capped Monday’s rally, for further bullish signal, with break above daily Kijun-sen / cloud top trigger (20692/20703), needed to confirm reversal. <br>
                                                        Hourly cloud (spanned between 20527 and 20487) offers solid support which should contain dips and keep intact key support at 20385 (daily Ichimoku cloud base).<br><br>

                                                        Spot Gold eased and closed in red on Monday after hitting fresh five-month high at $1295, in early Monday’s trading, on brief probe above weekly Ichimoku cloud top at $1292. The yellow metal remains strongly supported by rising geopolitical tension that triggered risk aversion and strongly increased demand for safe haven gold. Monday’s easing was signalled by overbought daily RSI / slow stochastic, with technical correction expected to ideally find support at above  rising hourly Ichimoku cloud (spanned between $1282 and $1275) which underpinned the rally since Apr 11).<br>
                                                        Final break and close above weekly cloud top is expected to spark acceleration for final attack at psychological $1300 barrier and next target at $1307 (Nov 2 high).  <br><br>

                                                    <p>Trading in FX and CFDs carries a high degree of risk. Prices may change quickly and may go down as well as up.

Contingent liability investment transactions, which are margined, require you to make a series of payments against the purchase price, instead of paying the whole purchase price immediately. You may lose more than your initial deposit. If the market moves against you, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional margin at short notice to maintain the position.
